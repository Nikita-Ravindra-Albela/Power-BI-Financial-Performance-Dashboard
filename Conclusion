The dashboard revealed that gross profit margin was only ~14% on total revenue of ~$117 M, highlighting significant margin pressure and a clear opportunity for improvement.

Segment-level insights found the “Channel Partners” segment had an exceptional margin of ~73%, compared to <1% for “Small Business”, signalling where growth and investment should be prioritised.

Geographic analysis showed over 43% of revenue came from USA & Canada, indicating heavy dependency on two markets and a need to diversify into Europe & emerging regions to reduce risk.

Product-level breakdown identified two top products contributing ~18–19% each to total profits, enabling optimized allocation of marketing & supply-chain resources toward high-impact SKUs.
